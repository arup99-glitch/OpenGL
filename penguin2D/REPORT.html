This code was written entirely by my own. However, I did refer to OpenGL online documentation as well as OpenGL code provided online to better understand how to work with OpenGL. A starter code was also provided to me by Prof. Kyros to help handle compilation and initialization of OpenGL for Assignment 1. 
</p> 

<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<p> 

I choose to program using the Object Oriented Programming Methodology as it will results in cleaner, flexible, and adaptable code. The drawback is that it took a lot of time to complete Assignment 1. 

The list of Objects, which I call Component in my code are given below. 
The commented code in Figure 1 shows the hierarchy in which the Components of each part of the penguin are connected. 
<pre>
// ----------- Penguin components defined ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Final Kinematics, from root to leaves 
// Notation: a->b means  'a' has 'b' in its iterator list 
// Current Progress: penguin->zoomer-> bodyJoint -> Body -> headJoint     -> Head     -> mouthJoint     -> Mouth
//			    ->translator	         -> handJoint     -> Hand
//		     	  	   		         -> leftLegJoint  -> LeftLeg  -> leftFeetJoint  -> leftFeet
//		     	  	    		         -> rightLegJoint -> RightLeg -> rightFeetJoint -> rightFeet
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Figure 1: Code shows the connection between the various entities of the penguins. 
</pre> 

Basically, a single Penguin object is the virtual base class of all Components. It contains an iterator <pre></pre>
of Components to be able to store all the various objects such as Torso, Leg, Head, Mouth, and Feet in its iterator.
<pre></pre>
 This design utilizes polymorphism and calls each different object to execute its own Display() (written as Update() in code) method. 
<pre></pre>
Although the transformation between each component's coordinates are handled by OpenGL, 
<pre></pre>
I had to compute suitable relative positions between these objects when drawing them. 
<pre></pre>
For example, I had to compute postions to allow the top of the Circular Torso to be placed
<pre></pre>
slightly below the bottom of the Rectangular Head. Also, I needed to make sure that the objects 
<pre></pre>
are connected in proper order such that they are drawn in correctly. Improper ordering of the 
<pre></pre>
objects in the connection can result in the Torso output overwriting the output of the Leg. 
<pre></pre>
This looks physically incorrect in reality. 
<pre>

</pre>

Components are added to the existing connection using the AddConnection() method that is available from the virtual base class, Entity. 
<pre></pre>
Transformation is done neatly by including a Joint object between different Components. 
<pre></pre>
As the output of a Penguin-liked Object is a specific one, the Joint Object is used 
<pre></pre>
to handle all specific computations of transformation between different Component's coordinate frame 
<pre></pre>
such that the final output appears like a Penguin. This allows each component to execute its methods 
<pre></pre>
within its own coordinate frame without realizing that it is part of a larger Entity, which is the Penguin. 
<pre>

</pre>

<p>Available Objects are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><code>Rectangle</code></strong></dt>
<dd>Draws fixed size rectangles.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>Circle</code></strong></dt>
<dd>Draws fixed size circles.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>Color</code></strong></dt>
<dd>Changes the current color.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>Zoomer</code></strong></dt>
<dd>Uniform scale of the model view matrix.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>Translator</code></strong></dt>
<dd>Translate the model view matrix.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>An advantage of this design is that it is very easy to specify the structure and hierarchy of the operations. For example, the following code:</p>
<pre><code>
Entity Hand;
Hand.AddComponent(new Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
Hand.AddComponent(new Rectangle(0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
Entity Body;
Body.AddComponent(new Joint(x, y, angle, arm));
Body.Update();
</code></pre>

This results in a Hand Component including a Color, Rectangle, and Joint in its iterator. When the Component that points to Hand calls Hand to Update(), 
Hand iteratively calls the Components that it points to Update() as well. 
<p>The penguin has the following parts:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Body/Torso</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The main entity that every other Component is attached to. This has two degrees of freedom for translation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Head</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The Head has the eyes and the upper mouth which moves with the head. The Head has one degree of freedom to rotate about the Body it is connected to.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Mouth</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The Mouth is connected to the Head with a joint, allowing the Mouth to be translated vertically. This simulates the Penguin opening and closing its mouth. </p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Left and Right Legs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The Legs are connected to the Body with joints. The joints provide a degree of freedom each to rotate each Leg. </p>
</dd>

<dt><strong>Left and Right Feet</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The Feets are attached to their respective Legs with joints, each providing a degree of freedom for rotation of the Feet.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="transformations">Transformations</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Translations</strong></dt>
<dd>All translations are done by <code>Joints and Translator</code>.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Rotations</strong></dt>
<dd>All rotations are also done by <code>Joints</code>.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Scales</strong></dt>
<dd>Only Uniform Scale is needed for the Penguin, as it does not physically look realistic for the Penguin to shear in any direction. It is called <code>Zoomer</code> in code. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="shapes">Shapes</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Rectangles</strong></dt>
<dd>Rectangles are drawn by using the Polygon with for vertices. 
</dd>
<dt><strong>Circles</strong></dt>
<dd>Circles are drawn by using the parametric equation of circles. Each circle has a <code>smoothness</code> that specifies the number of points used to draw the circle. The points smoothness increase with the size of the circle. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I successfully completed the entire Assignment. The Penguin is hardcoded to oscillate all its joins simultaneously like a pendulum. Small circles are drawn to depict the locations of the rotary joints. Finally, the output Penguin does look like a cute Penguin. There are the required 9 degrees of freedom to control using the spinners.
