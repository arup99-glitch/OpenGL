Design

The starter code was provided by the Professor. 

I chose to implement the system based on composable Classes of Components. Components are the basic unit of each Updated method such as 
objects, rectangles, Color, Light, Translation, Rotation. Entities are used to ensure matrix operations are preserved. Unlike Assignment 1, 
I created a new class called Wrapper. Wrapper is used so that it can execute Components in-order, whereby components that come earlier 
gets outputted before the component itself, and then output the next component. Similar to a BSP tree. 
It has function such as AddPrevious and AddNext. Finally, there is a class called supplier that is used to pass parameter values to other classes. 
These parameters often change value. 

Degrees of Freedom
Some of the requirements were unclear so the robot has 27 degrees of freedom.
The 2e degrees of freedom available to the robot.
Functionality
DOFs

1st-6th DOF for Overall Rotation and Translation of Penguin
7th DOF for head rotation 
8th DOF for beak rotation 
9th-16th DOF for right arm & left arm  rotation and elbow movement
17th-24th DOF for right leg & left leg  rotation, and knee movement
